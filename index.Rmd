### PhD Candidate
### Environmental Health Sciences
#### Mailman School of Public Health
#### Columbia University

<br> 

Lizzy received a BA in environmental science from [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) in 2010 and an MPH in epidemiology from [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University in 2016. She spent two years as a [Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/) volunteer in the Republic of Panama in between, where she helped to build energy-efficient cookstoves in her community and learned to throw a lasso.

She is currently working with the [Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health](http://ccceh.org/) under the mentorship of Drs. [Julie Herbstman](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/jh2678) and [Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/mk3961) to study the effects of prenatal and early lifecourse chemical exposures on child development. Her research generally involves the analysis of longitudinal data and complex mixtures of environmental exposures. Recent projects have focused on simultaneous exposure to multiple heavy metals and cognitive development in adolescents in a Bangladeshi cohort and interventions to reduce exposure to flame retardants of multiple classes in mothers and children in NYC.
